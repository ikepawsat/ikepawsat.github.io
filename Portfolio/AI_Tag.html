      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          I have two categories below, one, AI projects like my first attempt with AI, and my attempt at AI Tag.
          Each are shown first below, and following them past it are my Machine Learning projects, enjoy.
        </p>

      <h3>AI Tag</h3>
      <p>   Simply put, I saw a creative attempt at an AI Tag game and wanted to give it a shot myself. Before this, I had never made a 
        truly successful AI, let alone two that could learn off of eachother. This was single-handedly the most important project of
        my current career because of how many problems I had to overcome.

        <h3>Attempt 1</h3>
        <p>Having multiple scripts can be confusing, I quickily learned that I accidentally made the chaser get points for being
          further away so it found a way to glitch through the map. I fixed this and moved on.

          </a>
        </div>
        <h3>Attempt 2</h3>
        <p>The AIs began to work really well even after a short amount of training; however, I was not happy with them because
          they would run into walls or get confused why they could not go forward (because of a wall) because they could not see them.
          To solve this, I added ray tracing to each of them, pointing up,down, right, and left, to give them environmental information.

              </video>
            </a>
          </div>
          <h3>Attempt 3</h3>
          <p>I may have overloaded them with this new information, after about 1300 runs they seem to get worse and get stuck doing stupid
            things. To fix this I decided to add what I like to call a "reset". To do this, I take the average of 1000 runs, and on each
             run after I start to see if that rounds reward is less than 90% of the average. If it is, I reset it to the max reward neural network
             which I have saved in the program when each new max occurs.

          <h3>First AI Attempt</h3>
          <p class="w3-padding-32">
            Pictured above is my first AI game I attempted to build. At first, I was going to build an iOS "Lawn Mowing Simulator",
            testing my visual art skills along with my coding skills, but my Dad asked me how well an AI could do on it and I got curious.
            Yet, I had never worked on AI and this became my first (sadly unsuccessful) attempt at an AI. While it does not work, because
            I never copied the neural network to the new generation... oops, it gave me the knowledge to attempt my much larger AI Tag game.
